I'm a geek, totally and completely. I love everything technology related.
I love to know how our world operates, down to the physical.
I love to build things, physical and digital.
I'm a Journeywoman Electrician. I'm a self taught programmer.
Actually code was my first passion, it fascinated me being able to make the computer do something.
